This system is an interactive set of scatterplots along with a bar chart created using Datasaurus Dozen Dataset. 
All of the datasets in this Dataset has the same statistical properties but different visual structures.
To explore this,the users can start by looking at the main plots first - Dino plot and the bar chart.
When users brush on the Dino plot the data points similar to that of the brushed points are highlighted in the below 8 scatterplots below the main plot. Along with this the bar chart shows the mean and standard deviation of the brushed points. 
By default, the bar chart shows the mean and standard deviation of the entire Dino Dataset.
